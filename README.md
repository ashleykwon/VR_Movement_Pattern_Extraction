# VR_Movement_Pattern_Extraction
Used to extract flights (transition from one point to another in a VR environment without any direction or angle changes) and viewing angle changes during a VR simulation and to analyze distributions of movement data (e.g. flight lengths, azimuth angle changes ... etc.)

-Need a text file or a csv file with user coordinates and Euler angles collected from a VR simulation as an input
